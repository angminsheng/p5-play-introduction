# p5.js | Introduction to p5.play

This code along is a small introduction on [p5.play](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/). p5.play is a [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) library for the creation of games and playthings.


## Introduction

Lets create a simple parking lot with p5.js and p5.play.

## Instructions

This code along will help you to:
- Learn what is a sprite image and how to load them into your game.
- Learn how to detect collision between different sprite image.
- Implementing p5 sound and p5 dom addon library into the small game.

To start coding along with the lab. Head over to [this repository](www.google.de) to get a boiler plate which comes with all the addon libraries for p5.js.

### Iteration 1 - Creating the correct folder structure for our p5 project.

Let's start with structuring our folder.

```js
|-assets
|-js
|-p5
index.html
README.md
```

The ``p5`` folder contains all javascripts for the p5 library as well as the addon libraries like p5.play and p5.sound.
The ``js`` folder is the folder where we will be working on.
