# p5.js | Introduction to p5.play

This code along is a small introduction on [p5.play](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/). p5.play is a [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) library for the creation of games and playthings.


## Introduction

Lets create a simple parking lot with p5.js and p5.play.

## Instructions

This code along will help you to:
- Learn what is a sprite image and how to load them into your game.
- Learn how to detect collision between different sprite image.
- Implementing p5 sound and p5 dom addon library into the small game.

To start coding along with the lab. Head over to [this repository](www.google.de) to get a boiler plate which comes with all the addon libraries for p5.js.

### Iteration 1 - Creating the correct folder structure for our p5 project.

Let's start with structuring our folder.

```
|-assets
|-js
|-p5
index.html
README.md
```

The ``p5`` folder contains all javascripts for the p5 library as well as the addon libraries like p5.play and p5.sound.

The ``js`` folder is the folder where we will be working on.

We start by creating a ``main.js`` file inside the ``js`` folder. In this file, the main function from p5 library will be called. 

```js
// main.js

function setup() {
  createCanvas(WIDTH, HEIGHT);
}

function draw() {
background(0)
}
```

Now we will create a new file ``const.js`` inside our ``js`` folder that will store all our constant variable in the project.

```js
// const.js

const WIDTH = 800
const HEIGHT = 800
```

Don't forget to link all your javascript file in your ``index.html``.

## Iteration 2 - Creating our Game class.
Inside the ``js`` folder, create a ``Game.js`` where we will declare our Game class.
This Game class will be the main class that will create object instance from all the other classes we need later on.
For the moment let's just keep it simple.

```js
class Game {
  constructor() {
  }

  setup() {
  }

  draw() {
  }
}
```

## Iteration 3 - Creating our Player class.
Let's create a new file ``Player.js`` inside our ``js`` folder. In this file we will be declaring our Player class, which will be a police car where we can move around with. The player will be a sprite image created using the p5.play library. 
An image sprite is a collection of images put into a single image. However, it is also possible to use multiple image to create a sprite sheet. In our example today, we will be using a sprite sheet that is created from 3 images.

In order to increase the performance of our game, it is always a good idea to first preload all the assests like the images and audio files that we will be using in our project.

p5 offers a good way to preload our assests where we can simply call the ``preload`` function predefined by the p5 library.

Since this file might get bigger later on as we have more and more assests, let's create a new file ``preload.js`` inside our ``js`` folder where we handle all our preload.

```js
// preload.js

// the variable are declared globally so they can be accessed by the classes that needed them.

let playerAnimation;

function preload() {
  playerAnimation = loadAnimation(
    "../assets/Topdown_vehicle_sprites_pack/Police_animation/1.png",
    "../assets/Topdown_vehicle_sprites_pack/Police_animation/2.png",
    "../assets/Topdown_vehicle_sprites_pack/Police_animation/3.png"
  );
}
```
And our Player class will like this:

```js
class Player {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.velocity = 3;
  }

  setup() {
    this.sprite = createSprite(this.x, this.y, 30, 30);
    this.sprite.addAnimation("drive", playerAnimation);
    this.sprite.scale = 0.5;
  }
  }
```

The ``createSprite(x, y, width, height)`` function from p5.play will take in 4 parameter. Attention, the width and height here is not the width and height of the loaded sprite image. It is the width and height of the placeholder rectangle if an image is not provided. For more infomation, look into the official documentation of p5.play [here](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/docs/classes/p5.play.html#method_createSprite).

We can now create an instance of the Player object with the constructor inside the Game class like this:

```js
// Game.js

class Game {
  constructor() {
    this.player = new Player(WIDTH / 2, HEIGHT / 2);
  }

  setup() {
    this.player.setup();
  }

  draw() {

  }
}
```

Lastly, all we need to do now is to call the ``drawSprite`` function which draws all the sprites in the sketch if no parameter is given.

```js
// main.js

function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 800);
}

function draw() {
background(0)
drawSprite()
}
```

And now, you should be able to see your first sprite image on the canvas!

## Iteration 4 - Driving our new car around!

Now that we have a new car, let's try to move it around. The ``this.x`` and ``this.y`` defined inside the constructor are only used to intialized the position of the car. If we want to move it around, we have to modify the position of the sprite instead.

We can do that by changing the ``this.sprite.position.x`` and ``this.sprite.position.y`` of the object.

Our Player class will look like this at the end:

```js
class Player {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.velocity = 3;
  }

  setup() {
    this.sprite = createSprite(this.x, this.y, 30, 30);
    this.sprite.addAnimation("drive", playerAnimation);
    this.sprite.scale = 0.5;
  }

  draw() {
    this.keyIsDown();
  }

  keyIsDown() {
    if (keyIsDown(37)) {
      this.sprite.rotation -= 3;
    }
    if (keyIsDown(39)) {
      this.sprite.rotation += 3;
    }
    if (keyIsDown(38)) {
      this.sprite.position.x += sin(this.sprite.rotation) * this.velocity;
      this.sprite.position.y -= cos(this.sprite.rotation) * this.velocity;
    }
  }
}
```
``this.sprite.rotation`` controls the angle of the sprite image. The tricky part here is trying to move the car in the direction we are facing.

Take a look at the simple diagram below:
